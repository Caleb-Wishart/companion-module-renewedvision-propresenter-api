# ProPresenter API

This (Beta) Companion module allows you to remotely control ProPresenter *(version 7.9 and higher)* via it's <a href="https://openapi.propresenter.com" target="_blank">public API</a>  
❌ It will not work with older versions of ProPresenter that do not have the public API (<7.9).

### Configure ProPresenter To Be Controlled By Companion:

✅ **Enable Network** must be enabled in ProPresenter Network Settings.  
✅ The computer **IP Address** and the ProPresenter **Port** will be shown in ProPresenter Network Settings.
