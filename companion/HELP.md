# ProPresenter API

This is a BETA module that replaces the old ProPresenter module but uses the new open API instead of the the old *reverse-engineered* remote protocol.  
ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGESSS ðŸš§  
The module is not yet complete - you will find it's missing actions, variables, presets and feedbacks that you might expect.
But it is complete "enough" to be tested and "early adopters" may find it useful now.
Over time, more actions, variables, presets and feedbacks will be added.  
THIS DOCO IS NOT YET COMPLETED - It's barely started!  

This (Beta) Companion module allows you to remotely control ProPresenter via it's <a href="https://openapi.propresenter.com" target="_blank">public API</a>  
It will NOT work with older versions of ProPresenter that do not have the public API (<7.9).  
You can use the older "ProPresenter" module for versions of ProPresenter less than 7.9.  

### Configure ProPresenter To Be Controlled By Companion:
To setup this module you will need the to do the following:  
âœ… **Enable Network** must be enabled in ProPresenter Network Settings.  
âœ… Enter the computer **IP Address** and the ProPresenter network **Port** (both are shown in ProPresenter Network Settings)  

### Instructions for use:

#### Actions:
TODO:  
Introduce concept of active vs focused.
Introduce concept of naming convention (Actions are logically grouped by their naming convertion)
Introduce how to search for actions, knowing the naming convention
Introduce concept of trigger actions (vs say, presentation trigger)
When using indexes - counting starts at 0.
For the action: "Propresenter-API: Presentation: PresentationUUID: Index: Trigger", you can use "Active Presentation UUID" variable to get uuid of active presentation - this is a globally unique identifier of that presentation that should not change


#### Variables:
Some variables have a dynamic number (eg timers, stage display layouts).  You will notice that the id has the uuid which is a bit confusing, but this long uuid is globally unique and allows these variables to always work even if the names have duplicates.  In these cases, the description has the friendly names.


### Notes:
Note that a few API functions were introduced in later versions of ProPresenter so there might be one or two actions that don't work if you are running an older version of ProPresenter.  

Messages: Triggering supports text tokens only (Showing a dynamic number of text tokens for each select message, hurt my brain a bit - I kinda dread adding timers to the mix.  For now, timers can be configured and started seperately)

If you use  to "Presentation: PresentationUUID: Index: Trigger" to trigger a specific slide in a specific presentation that is not the currently active presentation in a playlist - you might expect a subsequent call to "Presentation: Active: Focus" to change focus to it within that playlist - but it does not, it will focus it in the library it lives in.
You can however, trigger the **first** slide in *any* specific presentation in a playlist using "Playlist: ID: Index: Trigger" and then once it's the active presentation you can then trigger specific slides within it with "Presentation: Active: Index: Trigger"

When using a Timer set action to update a timer, I have seen that doing an operation (start/reset) too soon after you have updated it seems to revert the changes made by timer set action - wait a little while or use the option to set AND perform operation.
